> A Babel preset that can automatically determine the Babel plugins and polyfills you need based on your supported environments.

```sh
npm install babel-preset-env --save-dev
```

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "browsers": ["last 2 versions", "safari >= 7"]
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

## How it Works

### Determine environment support for ECMAScript features

Use external data such as [`compat-table`](https://github.com/kangax/compat-table) to determine browser support. (We should create PRs there when necessary)

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/588473/19214029/58deebce-8d48-11e6-9004-ee3fbcb75d8b.png)

We can periodically run [build-data.js](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/scripts/build-data.js) which generates [plugins.json](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugins.json).

Ref: [#7](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/7)

### Maintain a mapping between JavaScript features and Babel plugins

> Currently located at [plugin-features.js](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugin-features.js).

This should be straightforward to do in most cases. There might be cases where plugins should be split up more or certain plugins aren't standalone enough (or impossible to do).

### Support all plugins in Babel that are considered `latest`

> Default behavior without options is the same as `babel-preset-latest`.

It won't include `stage-x` plugins. env will support all plugins in what we consider the latest version of Javascript (by matching what we do in [`babel-preset-latest`](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-latest/)).

Ref: [#14](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/issues/14)

### Determine the lowest common denominator of plugins to be included in the preset

If you are targeting IE 8 and Chrome 55 it will include all plugins required by IE 8 since you would need to support both still.

### Support a target option `"node": "current"` to compile for the currently running node version.

For example, if you are building on Node 4, arrow functions won't be converted, but they will if you build on Node 0.12.

### Support a `browsers` option like autoprefixer

Use [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) to declare supported environments by performing queries like `> 1%, last 2 versions`.

Ref: [#19](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/pull/19)

## Install

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-env
```

Or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn add babel-preset-env --dev
```

## Usage

The default behavior without options runs all transforms (behaves the same as [babel-preset-latest](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-latest/)).

```json
{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
```

## Options

For more information on setting options for a preset, refer to the [plugin/preset options](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#plugin-preset-options) documentation.

### `targets`

`{ [string]: number }`, defaults to `{}`.

Takes an object of environment versions to support.

Each target environment takes a number (you can also specify a minor versions like `node: 6.5`)

Example environments: `chrome`, `opera`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`, `ie`, `ios`, `android`, `node`, `electron`.

The [data](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugins.json) for this is generated by running the [build-data script](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/scripts/build-data.js) which pulls in data from [compat-table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table).

### `targets.node`

`number | "current" | true`

If you want to compile against the current node version, you can specify `"node": true` or `"node": "current"`, which would be the same as `"node": parseFloat(process.versions.node)`.

### `targets.browsers`

`Array<string> | string`

A query to select browsers (ex: last 2 versions, > 5%) using [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist).

Note, browsers' results are overridden by explicit items from `targets`.

### `targets.uglify`

`number | true`

UglifyJS does not currently support any ES6 syntax, so if you are using Uglify to minify your code, targeting later browsers may cause Uglify to throw syntax errors.

To prevent these errors - specify the uglify option, which will enable all plugins and, as a result, fully compile your code to ES5. However, the `useBuiltIns` option will still work as before, and only include the polyfills that your target(s) need.

> NOTE: Uglify has a work-in-progress "Harmony" branch to address the lack of ES6 support, but it is not yet stable.  You can follow its progress in [UglifyJS2 issue #448](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/448).  If you require an alternative minifier which _does_ support ES6 syntax, we recommend using [Babili](https://github.com/babel/babili).

### `loose`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Enable "loose" transformations for any plugins in this preset that allow them.

### `modules`

`"amd" | "umd" | "systemjs" | "commonjs" | false`, defaults to `"commonjs"`.

Enable transformation of ES6 module syntax to another module type.

Setting this to `false` will not transform modules.

### `debug`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

Outputs the targets/plugins used and the version specified in [plugin data version](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugins.json) to `console.log`.

### `include`

`Array<string>`, defaults to `[]`.

> NOTE: `whitelist` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major in favor of this.

An array of plugins to always include.

Valid options include any of the [babel plugins](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/plugin-features.js) or [built-ins](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env/blob/master/data/built-in-features.js), such as `transform-es2015-arrow-functions`, `map`, `set`, or `object.assign`.

This option is useful if there is a bug in a native implementation, or a combination of a non-supported feature + a supported one doesn't work.

For example, Node 4 supports native classes but not spread. If `super` is used with a spread argument, then the `transform-es2015-classes` transform needs to be `include`d, as it is not possible to transpile a spread with `super` otherwise.

### `exclude`

`Array<string>`, defaults to `[]`.

An array of plugins to always exclude/remove.

The possible options are the same as the `include` option.

This option is useful for "blacklisting" a transform like `transform-regenerator` if you don't use generators and don't want to include `regeneratorRuntime` (when using `useBuiltIns`) or for using another plugin like [fast-async](https://github.com/MatAtBread/fast-async) instead of [Babel's async-to-gen](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-async-generator-functions/).

### `useBuiltIns`

`boolean`, defaults to `false`.

A way to apply `babel-preset-env` for polyfills (via "babel-polyfill").

> NOTE: This does not currently polyfill experimental/stage-x built-ins like the regular "babel-polyfill" does.
> This will only work with npm >= 3 (which should be used with Babel 6 anyway)

```
npm install babel-polyfill --save
```

This option enables a new plugin that replaces the statement `import "babel-polyfill"` or `require("babel-polyfill")` with individual requires for `babel-polyfill` based on environment.

> NOTE: Only use `require("babel-polyfill");` once in your whole app. One option is to create a single entry file that only contains the require statement.

**In**

```js
import "babel-polyfill";
```

**Out (different based on environment)**

```js
import "core-js/modules/es7.string.pad-start";
import "core-js/modules/es7.string.pad-end";
import "core-js/modules/web.timers";
import "core-js/modules/web.immediate";
import "core-js/modules/web.dom.iterable";
```

This will also work for `core-js` directly (`import "core-js";`)

```
npm install core-js --save
```

## Examples

### Export with various targets

```js
export class A {}
```

#### Target only Chrome 52

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "chrome": 52
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

**Out**

```js
class A {}
exports.A = A;
```

#### Target Chrome 52 with webpack 2/rollup and loose mode

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "chrome": 52
      },
      "modules": false,
      "loose": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

**Out**

```js
export class A {}
```

#### Target specific browsers via browserslist

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "chrome": 52,
        "browsers": ["last 2 versions", "safari 7"]
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

**Out**

```js
export var A = function A() {
  _classCallCheck(this, A);
};
```

#### Target latest node via `node: true` or `node: "current"`

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "node": "current"
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

**Out**

```js
class A {}
exports.A = A;
```

### Show debug output

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [ "env", {
      "targets": {
        "safari": 10
      },
      "modules": false,
      "useBuiltIns": true,
      "debug": true
    }]
  ]
}
```

**stdin**

```sh
Using targets:
{
  "safari": 10
}

Modules transform: false

Using plugins:
  transform-exponentiation-operator {}
  transform-async-to-generator {}

Using polyfills:
  es7.object.values {}
  es7.object.entries {}
  es7.object.get-own-property-descriptors {}
  web.timers {}
  web.immediate {}
  web.dom.iterable {}
```

### Include and exclude specific plugins/built-ins

> always include arrow functions, explicitly exclude generators

```json
{
  "presets": [
    ["env", {
      "targets": {
        "browsers": ["last 2 versions", "safari >= 7"]
      },
      "include": ["transform-es2015-arrow-functions", "es6.map"],
      "exclude": ["transform-regenerator", "es6.set"]
    }]
  ]
}
```

## Caveats

If you get a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...` error when using the [object-rest-spread](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread) transform then make sure the plugin has been updated to, at least, `v6.19.0`.
