# Now that `babel-preset-env` has stabilized, it has been [moved into the main Babel mono-repo](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env).

The move makes it much easier to release and develop in sync with the rest of Babel!

This repo will be made read-only, as all of the issues/labels have been moved over as well. Please report any bugs and open pull requests over on the [main mono-repo](https://github.com/babel/babel).
