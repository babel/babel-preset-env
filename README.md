# We have moved this package ("babel-preset-env") into the [main Babel repo](https://github.com/babel/babel) under a [here](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/experimental/babel-preset-env).

> We have moved over all the open issues at the time, and will make this repo read-only. If you have an issue re-open it in the babel/babel repo as we won't be using this one anymore! Thanks ðŸ™‚

> This will make it easier to release/develop in sync with the rest of the code! I wasn't sure it was going to work out earlier so it was in a separate repo, but now it's a pain to keep it apart!
